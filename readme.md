#### Software

The [Fast LED library] is a user friendly library to control WS2811 lighting with an Arduino.

#### Hardware

The lights are WS8011 fully addressable LED strips controlled by an Arduino board, enabling any combination of patterns you want. It is powered by a 10,000 mAh USB battery pack. Everything is assembled using clear packing tape for easy assembly/disassembly.
